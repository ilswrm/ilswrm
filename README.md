### Hi, I’m Ilse — but I build as **ilswrm** 🍥

I’m a creative developer from Mexico blending code, art, and music. Currently diving deep into frontend development, with a soft spot for interactive interfaces, visual storytelling, and thoughtful user experiences 🩷

I’m building my portfolio from scratch — one pixel, one project, one curiosity at a time.  
Expect a mix of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a growing love for React, and experiments that feel like a song.
🚀 Learning Lenis and sharpening frontend basics.  
Looking forward to creative teamwork.

This is my little digital lab. If it blinks, moves, or makes you feel something, I’m probably into it.
