### Hi, I’m Ilse — but I build as **ilswrm** 🍥

I’m a creative developer from Mexico blending code, art, and music. Currently diving deep into frontend development, with a soft spot for interactive interfaces, visual storytelling, and thoughtful user experiences 🩷

I’m building my portfolio from scratch — expect a mix of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and experiments that feel like a song.

🚀 Learning Lenis and sharpening frontend basics.  

Looking forward to creative teamwork.
